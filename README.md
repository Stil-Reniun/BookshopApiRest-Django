# Bookshop Api Rest
BookshopApiRest is a REST API based on Django 5 and its Rest-framework library, designed to provide a wide range of functionalities for an online bookstore. From publishing books to making purchases and interacting through comments, the API encompasses all essential features of a modern bookshop. With the use of JWT access tokens for authentication across all operations, comprehensive security for data and transactions is ensured.


## Key Features
- **Secure Authentication and Authorization:** Utilizes a JWT (JSON Web Tokens) system to enable users to securely perform designated functions. It allows for secure login and registration, ensuring the protection of users' data.
- **Advanced Functionalities for Administrators:** Administrators have access to various management functions, including overall book management. They can create, delete, edit, and update books, as well as manage associated comments.
- **User Comments on Books:** Users can leave comments on books available for sale, sharing their experiences and reviews. This encourages interaction and allows other users to make informed decisions about which books to purchase.
- **User Management Ease:** Simplifies user management, enabling administrators to efficiently manage user accounts. This includes functions such as creating, editing, and deleting user accounts, as well as managing permissions and roles.
